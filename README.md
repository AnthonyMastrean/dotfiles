# dotfiles

My precious dotfiles

## Getting Started

I don't really know what I'm doing here yet, so the "getting started" is pretty lame. Clone this repository anywhere. It should work from any path. But, remember, you should modify the files in this repo and not on your local machine. So, I like to put it "near" my real dotfiles.

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:AnthonyMastrean/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```

## Usage

Then, you can overwrite any _older_ dotfiles in your home directory with ones from this repository.

```bash
$ rake update
```
